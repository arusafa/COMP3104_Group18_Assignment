- What is a DevOps engineer?
A DevOps engineer is an IT generalist who should have 
a wide-ranging knowledge of both development and operations, 
including coding, infrastructure management, system administration, 
and DevOps toolchains. DevOps engineers should also possess 
interpersonal skills since they work across company silos to 
create a more collaborative environment. 

DevOps engineers need to have a strong understanding of common 
system architecture, provisioning, and administration, but must 
also have experience with the traditional developer toolset and 
practices such as using source control, giving and receiving code 
reviews, writing unit tests, and familiarity with agile principles.

- Roles and responsibilities
The role of a DevOps engineer will vary from one organization to 
another, but invariably entails some combination of release engineering, 
infrastructure provisioning and management, system administration, 
security, and DevOps advocacy. 
Release engineering includes the work required to build and deploy 
application code. The exact tools and processes vary widely depending 
on many variables, such as what language the code is written in, how 
much of the pipeline has been automated, and whether the production 
infrastructure is on-premise or in the cloud. Release engineering 
might entail selecting, provisioning, and maintaining CI/CD tooling 
or writing and maintaining bespoke build/deploy scripts.

Infrastructure provisioning and system administration include deploying 
and maintaining the servers, storage, and networking resources required 
to host applications. For organizations with on-premise resources this 
might include managing physical servers, storage devices, switches, and 
virtualization software in a data center. For a hybrid or entirely 
cloud-based organization this will usually include provisioning and 
managing virtual instances of the same components.
